EncryptoChat is a messaging application that stores information encrypted, which means no one can see what you have talked about on this app, in case the databases are hacked. For added security, the email is encrypted too.

This app can help you chat with others instantly, send images, and customize your profile.

The site can be accessed at: https://encryptochatapp.netlify.app/
